# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Items Checked | Passed | Failed |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **0** |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All 26 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- 6 user stories cover the complete user journey from content consumption to capstone completion
- 15 measurable success criteria defined with specific metrics
- Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults made during specification

## Next Steps

1. Run `/sp.clarify` if stakeholder review identifies additional questions
2. Run `/sp.plan` to begin implementation planning
