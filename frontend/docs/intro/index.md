# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to this comprehensive course on building intelligent robots! This textbook will guide you through the essential technologies and techniques used in modern humanoid robotics and physical AI systems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Build robot control systems** using ROS 2, the industry-standard middleware for robotics
- **Create realistic simulations** using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for safe testing
- **Implement AI perception** systems for vision, sensing, and environment understanding
- **Integrate language models** for natural human-robot interaction through voice and text

## Course Structure

This course is divided into four main modules plus a capstone project:

| Module | Topic | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System | 2 weeks |
| 2 | Simulation - The Digital Twin | 2 weeks |
| 3 | NVIDIA Isaac - The AI-Robot Brain | 2 weeks |
| 4 | VLA - Vision-Language-Action | 2 weeks |
| Capstone | Build Your Humanoid | 4 weeks |

## Who Is This For?

This course is designed for:

- **Software engineers** looking to transition into robotics
- **Robotics enthusiasts** who want to build intelligent systems
- **AI practitioners** interested in embodied AI and physical systems
- **Students** studying computer science, electrical engineering, or mechatronics

## Prerequisites
