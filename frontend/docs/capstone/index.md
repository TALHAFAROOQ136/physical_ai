# Capstone Project: Build Your Humanoid

The capstone project brings together everything you've learned to build a complete humanoid robot system.

## Project Overview

You will design, build, and demonstrate a humanoid robot system that:

- **Perceives** its environment using sensors
- **Plans** actions using AI and language models
- **Executes** tasks through simulation
- **Interacts** naturally with humans

## Project Timeline

| Milestone | Focus | Duration |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | System Design | 1 week |
| 2 | ROS 2 Foundation | 1 week |
| 3 | Simulation Setup | 1 week |
| 4 | AI Integration | 1 week |
| 5 | Presentation | 1 week |

## Deliverables

1. **System Architecture Document** - Design decisions and rationale
2. **Working ROS 2 Package** - Robot control software
3. **Simulation Environment** - Gazebo or Isaac Sim world
4. **Demo Video** - 5-minute demonstration
5. **Final Presentation** - 15-minute presentation
