# Module 2: Simulation - The Digital Twin

Simulation is essential for robotics development. It allows you to test robot behaviors safely, iterate quickly, and generate training data for AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models and simulation worlds
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization
- Test robot behaviors before deploying to hardware

## Why Simulate?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Test dangerous scenarios without risk |
| **Speed** | Iterate faster than with hardware |
| **Cost** | No wear and tear on physical robots |
| **Reproducibility** | Repeat experiments exactly |
| **Scale** | Run many simulations in parallel |

## Module Structure

1. **[Gazebo Basics](/docs/module-2-simulation/gazebo-basics)** - Physics simulation with Gazebo
2. **[Unity Integration](/docs/module-2-simulation/unity-integration)** - High-fidelity visualization

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Module 1: ROS 2](/docs/module-1-ros2)
- Understanding of URDF robot descriptions
- ROS 2 Humble with Gazebo installed
